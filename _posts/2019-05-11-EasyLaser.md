This was my third year project - it's a simulation of sailing a dinghy for teaching purposes.
It's made in Unity and you need a controller to play it. The right trigger (analogue) brings the sail
in and out, and the left control stick controls the rudder.

Play it <a href="https://sailing.netlify.app/">here</a>
