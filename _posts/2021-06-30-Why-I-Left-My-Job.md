Since I've been interviewing for jobs, I've had to explain my decision to leave my last job
pretty much every time. It's a reasonable question to ask, and one that I didn't have an answer
to myself for a while.

My previous position was as a Java software engineer, after finishing my computer science course.
I was doing fairly well there, despite the fact that we were loaded with too much work. I had to
very quickly go from learning the ropes to implementing whole features by myself.

A very damning thing about the way we worked was the complete lack of anything you could call
DevOps. We had a Jenkins server, but it was used almost entirely for managing releases. The tests
that we had were broken in many places, so we were to ignore test failures during the build process
for our product. I wrote tests for my code, but it was very difficult to test parts where my code
interacted with the core - there was no easy way to mock inputs to the large complex system. We
had a Jira board, but it was sloppily managed.

As lockdown began in March, we started working from home. In terms of technology, we were actually
decently equipped for this - our work was done entirely on laptops, and we could connect to the
office network via the VPN. This was in place to handle support incidents, but it was mostly fine
for working too.

My work started out okay, but mounting project pressure and bad work habits started to spiral. By
the summer I was really miserable. Afraid that the work I had done during the day was not enough, 
work began to eat into my evenings, which became later and later while my sleep got worse and worse.
I was rapt with guilt about being behind on my work. The correct thing to do would be to tell my
manager about this, but I was always 'one more all-nighter' away from fixing it all without having
to damage my pride. Something had to give, and my solution was to give my notice. I didn't want
to do it anymore, I didn't have to do it anymore.

Management were upset by this, but didn't probe much for feedback. Not that I helped. Again, not
wanting to hurt my pride, my reason for leaving was pretty vague, and I wanted to keep it that way.
I had plenty of half-truths to tell - I even believed them myself. I wasn't interested in the work,
I wanted to do better things, I wanted to further my education. All valid reasons, all partially
true. I just didn't want to reveal the real reason.

## Three Months

The company has a policy that you are to give three months notice. I think this is terrible. I
understand the reasons behind it - they want to mitigate the risk that comes from hiring. I
understand that hiring and training employees just for them to leave at the flick of a switch is
waste. However, the effect it had on me was not good. At all times there was a conflict in my head.
On the one hand, I have a moral duty to my team, who I liked working with, to clean up after myself
and pass on my knowledge. On the other hand, nothing I do now at the company matters personally to
me. It even turned out that I wouldn't be there to deliver the project I was destroying myself over.

Those three months were probably the worst of my entire life, and there are some solid contenders too.
I felt every day that I was letting everyone down, while I panicked so much that work was slow and
painful. What would usually take me a day would take me a week or more. I was in a terrible state
and I still didn't want to ask for help. My manager wasn't tracking my time very well or at all, which
meant that nothing flagged up any problems. I was at this point mostly setting up servers and
databases, which I was not qualified to do and essentially had to google everything. A lot of time
was spent fielding emails back and forth to the client's ops department, asking for ports to be
opened, config to be changed, or our user accounts to be activated again.

On top of this I'm having to interact with our clients, which I hated doing. The meetings would take
huge chunks out of the day and all our clients were rightfully disappointed that our software didn't
work properly. We had a few major incidents, where I'd have to ssh into the client's servers and 
grep through the logs for errors while their engineers shouted at us over Microsoft Teams. I just felt
ashamed.

On my final day I didn't even say goodbye. I left my laptop at HR and went home. I was happy.

## I don't want this to happen again

Needless to say, I don't want this to happen again - not to myself, not to anyone I'm working with.
Unfortunately, many companies work this way, and many programmers have similar attitudes to the one
I had. My solution was to withdraw and surrender, instead of working to find a solution, however
painful that might be.

## ADHD

I had thought that I might have ADHD for a few years before this, but this situation really got me
interested in actually finding out. My opinion on the matter in the past had been uncharitable - I
didn't think mental illnesses like ADHD or depression were 'real', just excuses for poor 
productivity caused by youtube and computer games.

The process for some can be really difficult, but fortunately
the facilities in Salford were pretty quick at getting me diagnosed. I would suggest going with 
private treatment if possible, especially if your job's health insurance plan would cover it. After
some study on the symptoms of ADHD, I was able to pretty easily match up my symptoms to the DSA-5
list of symptoms, which I compiled into a 2000-word essay to give to my doctor. This was quite
effective and my eventual meeting with the psychologist was short and easy. A few weeks later and I
would have my medication, which helps massively with my ability to work. It would be January when
I finally got it.

## Self-worth

My approach over the years has fundamentally been wrong. I wanted to be seen as flawless, untouchable,
independent. Any mistake I made would feel like a dagger in my chest. I wasn't aware of my limitations
and was disappointed in myself all the time. Any improvement I could make to myself wouldn't be enough,
I would obsess over wasted time and compare myself to others, I lamented over having too many years of
age and not enough of experience. My expectations of myself were designed to make me as miserable as
possible.

My aim currently and as I proceed is to let things go, do the best I can, and to forgive myself when I
don't. The way I see it is that it's the only way for me to be healthy. I also have to make a conscious
effort to measure myself, and make changes to the way I work and live to improve my results.

## What have I been up to since?

In terms of usable released stuff, not a whole lot. I made a game in January, which you can play online,
which I like a lot. I'm also working on a project 

## What I'm going to do in the future

- Improve tooling and automation - a lot of the problems I had could have been sorted out by spending
some time writing software to help out. Instead of waiting to be asked to do this, it's up to me to
  take the initiative and make it clear that it's worth me using a few hours or days to make a
  permanent improvement.
  
- Be honest and open - my colleagues are human and understand if I've made mistakes or am behind on the
work. It's in all our interests to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks.
  
- Make work visible - this is a management suggestion, but I've learned that it's really important to
track how long is spent on work vs the estimate provided. Logging this stuff makes future time estimates
  much easier.
  
- Be healthy - it doesn't matter how smart you are, your health is a massive factor in getting anything
done. This applies to both physical and mental health. I've since started running and cycling, and on the
  days I actually do some exercise, I feel much better. This includes getting plenty of sleep and setting
  boundaries when working from home.
