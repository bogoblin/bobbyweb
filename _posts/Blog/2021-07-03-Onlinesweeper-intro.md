Frankly, this is just something I want to exist on the web. An infinite, persistent minesweeper board where
people from all over the world join in to clear as much as possible for no particular reason.

I came up with the idea a few years ago and made a prototype over a long night, which was really fun. It was
my first foray into node.js, and I enjoyed the really fast learning process. For me, introductory
programming language books
are a waste of time - pick a project and start it, google everything, and don't worry about code quality.

I'm a lot better at node and programming in general then I was back then, so I've decided to tackle the project
again. The prototype was cool and fun, but it wasn't infinite - it was on a finite grid, and it was a bit buggy
when tracking people's score.

Over the past few weeks I've been working on this on and off, and before I go any further I'd like to document
the process.
