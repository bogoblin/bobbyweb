<h1>I want to download every YouTube video I watch</h1>
<p>There have been many times where I have watched something online only for it to be removed later, either by its
creator, or by YouTube. This stuff can be very juicy.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Here's my goals for this project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every YouTube video I watch is automatically downloaded.</li>
    <li>The downloaded videos are sorted into directories by channel name.</li>
    <li>The downloaded videos are named the title of the video at time of download.</li>
    <li>It should be non-invasive, and I shouldn't have to change the way in which I access YouTube.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The plan</h2>
<p>This project will be split into two parts - the first is a server, which will download videos when it is sent
an instruction to do so. This instruction will be sent from the second part of the project - a browser extension
that will monitor my YouTube traffic.</p>
<h2>The server</h2>
<p>Currently, the best way to download YouTube videos is with youtube-dl, which is a python module, so I'm going to
write the server in python which should make it easy to use. It's been a while since I've written anything in
Python, so this should be interesting.</p>
<p>I'm using Flask for the server, because it's quite compact. The initial goal is to get the server to accept
a POST request and print the body - I'll worry about downloading the videos later. I'm creating a form to send
this POST request so that I don't have to use postman.</p>
<img src="img/testform.png">
<p>This form simply submits a form with the 'url' field containing what is in the text box. Here's the server
code:</p>
<pre lang="python">
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('form.html')


@app.route('/download', methods=['POST'])
def download():
    print(request.form['url'])
    return redirect('/')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
</pre>
<p>Simple! Now time to download the videos. After importing youtube_dl, it is very simple to use, and our
download route now looks like this:</p>
<pre>
@app.route('/download', methods=['POST'])
def download():
    with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        ydl.download([request.form['url']])
    return redirect('/')
</pre>
<p>So this works, in that it downloads the video, but I'd like to be able to choose the location that the files
are downloaded to, rather than just going where the program is run from. youtube_dl allows you to choose the
path that downloads are saved to. We can control this behavior with the options argument we pass to the
constructor. It took me a while to realise that you have to put an 's' after the templates.</p>
<pre>
download_dir = r'D:\YouTube'

ydl_opts = {
    'outtmpl': os.path.join(download_dir, "%(uploader)s", "%(title)s.%(ext)s")
}
</pre>
<p>There are a few different options I can pick for the folder name - the documentation lists uploader, creator,
channel, uploader_id, and channel_id. I don't want to use the ids (I'd like the directories to be human readable),
so I tried out uploader, creator, and channel. Testing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this video</a>,
I get:</p>
<ul>
    <li>uploader: RickAstleyVEVO</li>
    <li>creator: Rick Astley</li>
    <li>channel: Official Rick Astley</li>
</ul>
<p>After trying with some other videos, I'm going with uploader, which seems to in most cases be equal to channel.
creator is sometimes NA, which I obviously don't want. I'm not sure exactly how this works but I'm happy with it
for now. The program is very basic but definitely functional, so it's time to move on...</p>
<h2>The browser extension</h2>
<p>The quickest way to get a browser extension like this running is to use a userscript, which you can run using
the Tampermonkey add-on. So while I may turn this into a proper browser extension later (which I've
<a href="/garfield">done before</a>), it will initially run like this to make things easier for me. So here's
the initial script:</p>
<pre>(function() {
    'use strict';

    function sendYtDlRequest(url) {
        const params = new URLSearchParams();
        params.append('url', url);

        fetch('http://localhost:5000/download',
            {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
                },
                body: params
            })
            .then(() => {
                // todo: check response
            })
            .catch(() => {
                // todo: handle this
            })
    }

    let currentUrl;
    setInterval(() => {
        if (currentUrl !== location.href) {
            currentUrl = location.href;
            sendYtDlRequest(currentUrl);
        }
        }, 2000);
})();</pre>
<p>It's crude but it works. There doesn't seem to be an event for checking if the window location has changed,
so I have to use setInterval() to poll location.href. I don't really have a problem with this.</p>
<p>So this is working - there are improvements that could be made, but I'm happy with this for now, and I'm going
to use it for a while and see if anything goes wrong with it before I do any more work on it. You can check out
the project on github <a href="https://github.com/bogoblin/YTDLserver">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Making improvements</h2>
<p>One thing I immediately noticed is that if you visit a channel page or a playlist, all the videos will be
downloaded! As much as I love archiving things, I think that's a bit excessive. To fix this, I added a line to
extract the info about the page before downloading, so it can be checked. Then I check if the property
webpage_url_basename is watch - if not, then it's a channel or a playlist. This is almost enough, but if you are
watching a playlist, it will still download the whole playlist. To stop this, youtube-dl has the noplaylist
option.</p>
