    <div class="content"><p>Hi, Iâ€™m Bobby. I studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of Manchester</strong>, graduating with a <strong>1st class</strong> degree in 2019. Since then, I have had four years of experience as a working software engineer exploring a wide range of technologies. I like my builds fast, my tasks automated, and my tests green.</p>
<h2 id="spareroom">SpareRoom</h2>
<p><em>Software Developer | 2Â½ years</em></p>
<p>Primarily back-end engineering using <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>. I have also worked on a number of front-end projects using <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. My work here has involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing a domain specific language for perl comments so that we could localise every string in the codebase to US English and French.</li>
<li>Sped up the deployment process by 12X by parallelizing everything.</li>
<li>Wrote a bunch of <strong>Github Actions</strong> to automatically check for some commonly occurring issues.</li>
<li>Prevented someone from being fired by finding and fixing a bug in the admin panel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digital-applications-international-dai">Digital Applications International (DAI)</h2>
<p><em>Software Developer | 1 year</em></p>
<p>Did a little stint here until I got burned out by COVID. I was writing <strong>Java</strong> backend code for a <strong>Spring</strong> based web application that multiple high-profile companies were using. In this time, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote what I now realise was a horrible abstract class for making HTTP requests to various APIs. It worked though.</li>
<li>Read many large PDFs from shipping companies about the arcane details of their APIs, and wrote schemas and interfaces for them.</li>
<li>Championed unit testing with <strong>JUnit</strong> and <strong>Mockito</strong>.</li>
<li>Wrote various internal tools to improve the deployment process, which was just sshâ€™ing into servers and running commands.</li>
<li>Had up to 12 terminal windows open at once for checking logs for one of our customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="university-of-manchester">University of Manchester</h2>
<p><em>B.Sc. Computer Science - 1st Class Degree</em></p>
<p>Apart from doing pretty well academically, I was also involved in some relevant extracurricular activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participated in ACM ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) events, including going to University of Bath for the North West Europe regionals. We wrote our solutions in <strong>C++</strong> so that we didnâ€™t have to deal with a garbage collector.</li>
<li>Created original problems and organised the Staff Vs Student contest in 2018 and 2019, a ICPC-style event for the Computer Science department. This included setting up the web server, which is a <strong>PHP</strong> application called DOMjudge.</li>
<li>This lead to me doing a paid summer project where I created COMPJudge, an online automated testing system for programming coursework. This was used for the algorithms courses and mostly worked well. I was a TA on that course and helped the students and other TAs with the system.</li>
<li>Taught Python programming to non-CS students.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Onlinesweeper - a massively multiplayer online infinite Minesweeper game, with a Node.js backend and a JavaScript frontend. Playable in a browser <a href="https://onlinesweeper-5i7y9.ondigitalocean.app/">here</a> (warning, quite addictive).</li>
<li>Participated in game jams and hackathons. You can see these mini-projects on my website <a href="https://bogoblin.com">bogoblin.com</a>.</li>
