Hi, I'm Bobby. I studied **Computer Science** at the **University of Manchester**, 
graduating with a **1st class** degree in 2019. Since then, I have had four
years of experience as a working software engineer at two companies, exploring
a wide range of technologies. I like my builds fast, my tasks automated,
and my tests green.

I'm currently based in south Manchester, and I am
looking for a hybrid or remote role where I can solve problems
in a robust and efficient manner, whilst learning from more experienced
developers.
