Hi, I'm Bobby. I studied **Computer Science** at the **University of Manchester**, 
graduating with a first class degree in 2019. Since then, I have had four
years of experience as a working software engineer exploring
a wide range of technologies.

## SpareRoom 
*Software Developer | August 2021 - November 2023*

Primarily back-end engineering using **Perl** and **MySQL**. I have also worked on a number of front-end projects
using **JavaScript**, **JQuery**, **TypeScript** and **React**. My work here has involved:

- Writing a domain specific language and parser for perl comments so that we could localise our site.
- Sped up the deployment process by 12X by parallelizing everything.
- Improved build, testing and deployment processes with Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Bash scripts, and more for our GCP based infrastructure.
- Prevented someone from being fired by finding and fixing a bug in the admin panel.

## Digital Applications International (DAI)
*Software Developer | September 2019 - October 2020*

I was writing **Java** backend code for a **Spring** based web application
that multiple high-profile companies were using. In this time, I:

- Wrote application code that communicated with the APIs of the shipping companies we were working with.
- Championed the use of unit testing with **JUnit** and **Mockito**.
- Wrote various internal tools to improve the deployment process by moving repetitive tasks to a Jenkins continuous integration server.
- Had up to 12 terminal windows open at once for checking logs for one of our customers.

## University of Manchester
*B.Sc. Computer Science - 1st Class Degree*

Apart from doing pretty well academically, I was also involved in some relevant extracurricular activities:

- Participated in ACM ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) events, including going to University of Bath for the North West Europe regionals. We wrote our solutions in **C++** so that we didn't have to deal with a garbage collector.
- Created original problems and organised the Staff Vs Student contest in 2018 and 2019, a ICPC-style event for the Computer Science department. This included setting up the web server, which is a **PHP** application called DOMjudge.
- This lead to me doing a paid summer project where I created COMPJudge, an online automated testing system for programming coursework. It was written in a mixture of **Node.js**, **Python** and **C**, with **Bootstrap** and **JQuery** on the frontend. I was a TA on that course and helped the students and other TAs use the system.
- Taught Python programming to non-CS students as part of a Computer Science society (UniCS) effort.

## Projects

- Onlinesweeper - a massively multiplayer online infinite Minesweeper game, with a Node.js backend and a JavaScript frontend. Playable in a browser [here](https://onlinesweeper-5i7y9.ondigitalocean.app/) (warning, quite addictive).
- Participated in game jams and hackathons. You can see these mini-projects on my website [bogoblin.com](https://bogoblin.com).
