<h1>Presto</h1>
<img src="img/cover-s.jpg">
<p>Presto is Rush's 13th studio album, released in 1989 and produced by Rupert Hine.</p>
<p>Presto is a really interesting album, and one I think is overlooked by a most Rush fans. They're definitely in pop mode at this point, but they're able to write catchy songs that are also musically interesting, taking the ornamentation of the very proggy early stuff and distilling it into a more accessible package.</p>
<p>I hope that this review prompts you to give this album a listen or re-listen, there's some great stuff on here.</p>
<h2>Track by Track</h2>

        <h3>Show Don't Tell</h3>
        <em>you can twist perceptions - reality won't budge, you can raise objections - I will be the judge - and the jury</em>
        <p>Rush always open their albums with a bang, and Show Don't Tell is no exception - this song has some of Peart's sharpest drumming, a fantastic bass solo from Geddy, and some great guitar riffs. Show Don't Tell is a song about how your actions are more important than your words, using the courtroom as a source for metaphor. I think it is both now, and was at the time, very apt given the litigious world we live in. The chorus is a call and response, which even if you haven't heard the song before, will have you singing along by the end.</p>

        <h3>Chain Lightning</h3>
        <em>reflected in another source of light; when the moment dies, the spark still flies, reflected in another pair of eyes</em>
        <p>This song is about how your attitude and emotions affect other people, and that a small amount of an emotion can 'feed back and resonate' in others. I love this song, not just for its theme, but it has some wonderful guitar by Alex, and the bass really hits. I also love Neil's cymbal work during the 'sun dogs fire on the horizon' parts, where the cymbal sound skips along on the off beats. That's nice!</p>

        <h3>The Pass</h3>
        <em>all of us get lost in the darkness, dreamers learn to steer by the stars</em>
        <p>What a beautiful song - and one that's very close to me. The lyrics deal with ideation of suicide. It's quite dark, but invokes hope too, both in the lyrics, and the triumphant guitar solo. The line 'Christ what have you done?' tops the song off for me, really putting into perspective what a terrible idea it would be to commit suicide. It's something that I think most people consider, and it's really terrible. If you're feeling awful, give this song a listen.</p>

        <h3>War Paint</h3>
        <em>boys and girls together, mistake conceit for pride - ambition for illusion, dreams for self-delusion</em>
        <p>Vanity, vanity, all is vanity! War Paint is an anthem about vanity, particularly in youthful conquest. The metaphor of war paint is used for both the girl and the boy in this song, the girl with her make-up, and the boy with his 'armour, and the charger in the garage' - it is a strong image and aims to ask people to get their priorities straight. The song calls for us to paint the mirror black! Musically I am a big fan of this song - I love how the verses let the bass lead, with minimal guitar, so that when it comes in for the bridge, it pops out. In the second verse, we get some flair with the guitar, building up to the boy's 'fight'. It also features a couple of brilliant Neil Peart drum fills, and a guitar solo that will make you pull some stank faces! This song is tight.</p>

        <h3>Scars</h3>
        <em>pleasure leaves a fingerprint as surely as mortal pain. In memories they resonate and echo back again</em>
        <p>Okay - we need to talk about the drums here. Neil pulls out all the stops here and creates such a wonderful sound. Songs like these really justify his massive drum kit. He's doing what seems like some kind of African rhythm, which I think is reinforced by the sparse instrumentation and some of the lyrics (eg. 'I hear the lions hunting in the Serengeti night', 'hungry child in the desert', 'I've stood upon a mountaintop and shouted at the sky').</p>
        <p>Lyrics wise, this song is about how all the events in your life leave permanent scars - of both pleasure and of pain. I take the message of the song to be that you should experience as much as possible, despite some bad experiences scarring you for life.</p>

        <h3>Presto</h3>
        <em>I had a dream of the open water, I was swimming away out to sea - so deep I could never touch bottom, what a fool I used to be</em>
        <p>The title track, and a particularly nice sounding Rush song. I'm not entirely sure what the lyrics are about, but there's some beautiful imagery here, so whatever it is I'm sure it's very profound. To me I sense a theme of regret - 'if I could wave my magic wand, I'd make everything all right', and 'what a fool I used to be'. What I do know is that this song has a great chord progression, and Lifeson plays it so well with that smooth choral clean guitar tone. I really like the last part of the song where the lines from the choruses overlap over the guitar solo.</p>

        <h3>Superconductor</h3>
        <em>Designing to deceive: that's entertainment!</em>
        <p>An upbeat, enthusiastic ode to the (at the time) emerging concept of celebrity. A 'superconductor' is an actor, and the lyrics describe how the entertainment industry curates and designs these personas to decieve, for a target market and the lowest common denominator - 'a strong and simple beat, that you can dance to'. In the second verse outlines how the actors themselves fall for this trap, believe what they are manufacturing and live in their own fantasy.</p>
        <p>This is a track that's bound to have you dancing and smoothly singing "Superconductor" during the chorus. The synthesisers really elevate this song, as do the multiple(!) key changes and the last couple of bars where Neil hits the snare on every beat.</p>

        <h3>Anagram (for Mongo)</h3>
        <em>he and she are in the house, but there's only me at home</em>
        <p>I like to imagine this song was conceived during a late night game of scrabble. Neil is just having fun with anagrams in this song, but it ends up sounding really poetic, I think because of the repeated sounds from using the same letters in multiple words. Really interesting to read the lyrics along to. I'd like to know who Mongo is, I suspect there's another anagram in the name of the song, but I haven't found it.</p>
        <p>Musically it's quite interesting too - it's not a very complex song but I like how the instrumentation in the verses gets more layered over time, and the staccato synth chords that enter during the second verse. Also, I can't help but croon along to Geddy's vocal zenith in this song - "the saint turns to siiiiiiin!!!!"</p>

        <h3>Red Tide</h3>
        <em>Now's the time to make the time, which hope is still in sight - let us not go gently to the endless winter night</em>
        <p>An intense and frightening song about the world's impending doom. I'm not sure what the 'new plague' is specifically, I think it's referring generally to societal and environmental decline. The song is a warning, one that I fear we have failed to act on. I'm not sure if the 'Red Tide' is communism or something more abstract. The lyrics in this song don't scream communism except perhaps the line 'bring a sea-change to the factory floor as the red tide covers the shore', but this seems to me to be a comment on over-consumption.</p>
        <p>The meaning of the lyrics are reinforced by the threatening sharp synths and the tense arpeggios.</p>

        <h3>Hand Over Fist</h3>
        <em>Take a walk outside myself, to some exotic land. Greet a passing stranger, feel the strength in his hand, feel the world expand.</em>
        <p>There's a bit of a strange rock paper scissors metaphor here, which appears on the record's sleeve, so it would seem to me that Neil was pleased with it, rather than it being as clumsy as it might sound on first listen. Maybe it's like this - hand over fist = a gesture of peace preventing an attack, which is compared with paper around a stone, from the rock paper scissors game, obviously being the same gesture. Then when scissors cut the paper, removing the peaceful option, there is only violence? Again, not sure, it's a theory, and I don't see quite how it would fit in with the rest of the song.</p>
        <p>The first verse describes being alone - thinking that you can handle it, but realising that you can't. Then the second verse seems to be the same voice, now angry at his partner - like the rest of the world they grow farther apart. Finally, he 'takes a walk outside himself', and grows, feeling the world expand.</p>
        <p>It's a catchy song and a fun one to dance to.</p>

        <h3>Available Light</h3>
        <em>Chase the light around the world, I want to look at life - in the available light</em>
        <p>Wow, what a way to end an excellent album. The subdued opening of the song sets the scene, and leaves space for the huge sound of the later parts of the song to grow into. There's a lot of metaphors about light in this song, which I think works really well. I particularly like the line "promise offered in the west, and broken in the east". The impression I get is that Neil Peart wants to experience as much as he can while on the earth - the setting of the sun a reminder that we all must die. To chase the sun around the world is futile, but we are reminded to try anyway. Be the restless wind, and chase the sun around the world, while you still have time.</p>
