<h2>Goofy Rush Videos!</h2>

<p>This video is amazing! Rush are experimenting with the green-screen technology, which was new at the time, to create a baffling and charming visual vortex where the band are flying around extremely unconvincingly. It's nonsense and I love it!</p>

<h2 id="Vinyl">My Rush Vinyl Collection</h2>
<p>I have some of their records but not all of them! I think it's wonderful to have vinyl records because
    the art is so much bigger, and there are liner notes and lots of pictures. I also love having Neil Peart's great
    lyrics in print so I can read them while listening to the album. I will buy any Rush vinyl I see when I go shopping
    for records.</p>

<h2 id="Bands">Bands I like that are like Rush</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dream Theatre - they are a heavy-metal band but they are also prog, and very inspired by Rush. If you like Rush then you might like their Album 'Images and Words'. I particularly like the song 'Take The Time'</li>
    <li>Queen - you know Queen! But they are great, and have lots of great songs.</li>
